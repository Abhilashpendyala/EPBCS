seasonality : sudden spikes or irregular patterns that repeat every year

example:

q4 sales spikes
summer electricity usage increases
jan/feb low travel expenses
holiday or march hiring process
year end marketing spends

forecast based on seasonality spikes

trend based forecasting often needs seasonal factors , not simple averages

sales in dec = 1.5 * normal
travel in q1 = 0.8 * normal

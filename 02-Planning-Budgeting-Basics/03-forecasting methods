the core forecasting methods are generic for all planning modules

1) Driver based forecasting:

driver: any input factor that drives a calculated output

** rate based drivers : sales growth , inflation, merit increase, benefits%, price increase %
** operational activity drivers: volume ( units sold), kwh consumption, headcount, hours worked, number of calls, number of machines, number of passengers, square footage(for rent), number of shipments
** finanical drivers : price, salary rate

the cells are values in the future are forecasted using drivers

drivers:
headcount
volume
price
hours
rate 
units * cost
headcount * salary grade * benefits %

Example: 
revenue= volume * price
salary forecast = headcount * salary rate * benefits *
energy cost = kwh * rate

------------------------

how drivers are entered ???
how calculations run ??
where driver accounts exist in chart of accounts ??
how driver inputs feed planning forms ??
how to build rules using drivers ???

2) trend based forecasting:
--------------------------------

trends that can be used to predict the future
** yoy growth percentage
** mom growth
** rolling 3 month average
** linear trend
** moving average
** seasonality patterns

example:

forecast jan= last jan * 1.05
forecast feb = average of last three months

epbcs has built in trend methods

3) zero based forecasting:
-----------------------------

every line item starts at zero and user must justify each amount

** opex planning
** non comp expenses
** travel/ training expenses
** it spend

as implementer : configure forms so that user manually inputs everything from scratch

4) incremental forecasting:
-----------------------------

** increase by 5% every year
** increase by 1% every month
** increase based on inflation assumption

expenses_forecast = expense last year + expense last year*inflation rate

5) rolling forecast
-----------------------

at feb 2025 --> forecast for march 2025 - feb 2026

epbcs has rolling forecast 

*** doubt ?? do we have to build rolling forecast based on drivers

ans: rolling forecast is only feature of looking forward with the current actuals, you still other forecasting methods to be able to produce numbers

6) run rate forecasting
-------------------------

use average of past months to estimate remaining months

jan - apr average = 100
remaining months = 100 each

7) scenario based forecasting
-------------------------------

best case
worst case
most likely
stress case

8) ai/ml based forecasting ( predictive planning)
-------------------------------------------------

regression
exponential smoothing
neural models


--------------------------------------------------------------------

module based forecasting : though the forecasting methods are same the logic will differ

1) financials: most forecasting - heavy

trend based
run rated
driver based
zero based
predictive planning

built in drivers we have are : revenue drivers, expense drivers, balance sheet assumptions, cash flow drivers

2) work force module -- employee driven

headcount-based calculations
salary grade
step rate/merit rate
benefits rate
employment type
taxes and social charges %
driver based fte calculations

3) capex module

asset type
asset class
useful life
depreciation method
in-service date
salvage value
capital spend

forecasts:

depreciation
amoritzation
accumulated depreciation
capital expenses schedules

4) projects

drivers:

labor cost rate
material cost
overheads
task duration
resource cost
funding source

forcasts:

project cost
completion cost
revenue

5) revenue module

uses trend + driver based forecasting

unit price
quantity
seasonality
cost per unit
inflation adjustment

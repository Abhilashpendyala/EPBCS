budget : financial plan for a year

budget is locked once it is planned.

budget cycle: how the business plans across time --> repeated process like annual budget, monthly forecast, quarterly outlook 

1) annual budget cycle:
high detail overview of deciding budget allocation, driven by revenue targets, cost control, headcount planning etc. involves multiple departments, takes weeks or months to prepare

epbcs implementation tasks:
-----------------------------
create budget scenario
define forms for data entry
create bottom up and top down alignment
configure approvals by entity ( appovals by entity means each entity submits their plans, and it has to go through approvals )

2) monthly forcast cycle:
to track expected performance during year
rolling forecasts for 18 months
less detailed than annual budget

EPBCS tasks
------------------
create forecast scenario
define driver based modules
load actuals to seed forecast
automate forecast calculations

3) quarterly forecast:

realigining major assumptions every quarter
more detailed than monthly forecast
adjust key drivers : sales growth, market trends fx rates

EPBCS tasks
------------
have scenarios , q1 outlook, q2 outlook
create forms that allow analysts to adjust drivers
update connected financial statements

Budget cycle stages
--------------------
top down budgeting targets  (can be achieved using versions)  --> not enabled for approvals
bottom up budgeting planning
driver based calculations
consolidation
approval workflow
publishing final budget

EPBCS functionalities to support these:
approvals
data forms
business rules
dashboards

what happens in organization

** looking at current year actuals and forecast, company decides to allocate budget,
** how budget allocation takes place ?? either setting targets at top level or allocating at bottom level
** here comes the concept of top down and bottom up budgeting --> can be achieved using versions
** how it is achieved .... (entity based) --> as entity defines business structure
          top level ---> targets are set at parent level and lower levels are distributed using formulas
          bottom level --> targets are passed onto base level and rolled upto target
** budget entity wise is planned and goes through approval
** budget is set for next year before the next fiscal year starts (setting, revenue goals, expenses,capex, headcounts, marigns)
** budget is approved by leadership

---> planning cycle starts after budgeting:

** actuals get loaded every day ( data loads )
** these actuals will seed monthly forecast models ( 12- 18 rolling forecast)
** after actuals are loaded, planners update forecast for remaining months to check performance, fix early variances, predict short term future and support operations and make decisions
** for every quarter, analysts try to look at overall budget to make corrections
** this is called quarterly outlook/ reforecast
** at the end of each quarter , big assumptions are revisited, reset expectations by changing drivers, course correct if budget looks unrealistic, provide revised guidance to management


--------------------

why rolling forecast for 18 months, if budget is for year ??

because business doesnt stop at that fiscial year
rolling forecast enables us to set budgets based on the future numbers
to understand long term impact on the budget and decisions made now
and because same application is used for next year

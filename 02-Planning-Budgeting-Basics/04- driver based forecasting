1) Driver based forecasting:

driver: any input factor that drives a calculated output

** rate based drivers : sales growth , inflation, merit increase, benefits%, price increase %
** operational activity drivers: volume ( units sold), kwh consumption, headcount, hours worked, number of calls, number of machines, number of passengers, square footage(for rent), number of shipments
** finanical drivers : price, salary rate

the cells are values in the future are forecasted using drivers

drivers:
-----------
headcount
volume
price
hours
rate 
units * cost
headcount * salary grade * benefits %

Example: 
revenue= volume * price
salary forecast = headcount * salary rate * benefits *
energy cost = kwh * rate

------------------------

how drivers are entered ???
how calculations run ??
where driver accounts exist in chart of accounts ??
how driver inputs feed planning forms ??
how to build rules using drivers ???

-----------------------------

drivers are maintained as accounts in epbcs

driver accounts:
sales_volume
unit_price
growth_rate
inflation_%
headcount
salary_rate
energy_kwh
depreciation rate

drivers are non transactional accounts of type non financial or statistical

***  drivers can also be maintained as smart lists ( categorical drivers ) --> attribute dmns ??

how drivers are entered ??

entered in planning forms just like normal account input
drivers are always input accounts of store type, they will not be dynamic calc in general

volume and price are inputed by financial users and revenue is generated by calculations

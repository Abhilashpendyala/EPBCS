Working capital= current assets - current liabilities

managing working capital is key for making profit in a business

Working capital is needed to maintain inventory , production , provide financing ( mostly sold on credit)

Do sales forecast, and inventory analysis to determine, how much to borrow for operations

Less is bad, more is worse.

more non performing assets doesn't contribute to business, less of performing assets will slow down operations and cause order delays

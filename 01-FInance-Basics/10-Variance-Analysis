variance = actual - planned

reasons for variance are at stake
1. why are we seeing variance
2. what happened
3. is it recurring 
4. what has to be done

variance is it favorable or not?

revenue : if actual is greater than planned , favorable
expense: if actual is greater than planned , unfavoarable

types of variance:

a. financial variance  (revenue, cost, profit)
b. cost accounting variance (material, labour, overhead, volume, efficiency)

a)

revenue volume = ( actual quantity - budjet quantity ) * budget price  ---> variance due to change in sales quantity
revenue price = ( actual price - budget price ) * actual quantity  ---> variance due to change in sp
mix variance = variance caused by change in volume of sales and price 

profit variance = revenue varaiance - cost variance

expense variance = actual expense - budget expense

b)

material price variance
material usage varaince
labor rate variance 
labor efficiency variance
variable overhead variance
fixed overhead variance

case study : revenue fell by 10%

break into: price impact, volume impact, mix impact

operating expenditure increases by 15%

break into: hr variance, rate variance, volume variance, exceptional variance

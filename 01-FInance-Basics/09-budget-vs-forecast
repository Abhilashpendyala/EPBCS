approaches in budgeting:
-------------------------

top down approach --> driven by parent or business level motives and targets for next cycle, company makes budget according to its vision or plan on a whole


bottom up approach --> driven by entity or region based targets, whatever the budget is demanded at entity level for reaching their targets is understood by finance leaders, and will plan the budget based on it.

best approach: hybrid approach is more sensible by considering the entity based targets and setting targets as a overall company

Debt Equity ratio = Total Debt / Share holders Equity

** Very high debt is risky, even at losses , you have to repay money **
** Debt used productively is good as it is cheapest form of money borrowing, doesn't dilute profits**
** low debt/equity ratio is expected, when compared to industry standards, when buying shares**
** high debts with low profits is risky, high debts with matching profits can be growth expected**
** high debt consumes cash, which increases cash outflows**

Interest coverage ratio = EBIT/ interest coverage expense

** indicates how easily a company can pay interest from profit **
** EBIT : operating profit + depriciation + amortization **
**  ICR = 1 ==> breakeven , company earns as much as it has to pay the interest **
** companies with high debt can be risk free if ICRs are high **
** movie budget suppose say thousand crores and it generates wealth of 10000 crore ** --> risk free
** only ebit is considered because interest is paid from operating profit and not net profit **


return on equity : net income / equity
** tells how much profit company makes from share holders money **
** low debt and high roe is good indicator for shareholders **


Return on capital employed = ebit/capital employed

capital employed = current assets - current liabilities

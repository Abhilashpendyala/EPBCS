DEBITS AND CREDITS   
------------------

Every transaction has two accounts involved ( Two sided Accounting )

One is credited , other is debited ---> Journal entry records a transaction

What should you credit, and what should you debit ???

    It totally came by arbitrary choice and has become a standard for accounting

Own --> Increases with Debits
Owe --> Increases with credits 

If what you own is increasing ----> Debit it
If what you owe is increasing ---> credit it 

The same rule is passed on to more accounts present in balance sheet

Assets = Liabilities + Equity --> LHS ( what you own , RHS what you owe ) --> always balanced

Assets = Liabilities + ( Ownership + Income - Expense )

Assets : what you own ---> debit with increasing
liabilities : what you owe ---> credit with increasing
Expenses : decrease what you owe ---> debit with increasing 


Nature of account:
---------------------

Debit Nature of account : Account increases when you debit it --> Assets and Expenses
Credit Nature of account: Account increases when you credit it  --> Liabilities, Equity & Income


Your bank Account is Asset for You, Liability for bank
--->   Pers bank acc: You debit money in your account, When banks speaks they credit money in your account

Credit cards are your liability and banks asset
--->   Credit card: Credited when you do a purchase, Debited when you repay

In Two sided Accounting ----> TRIAL BALANCE : TOTAL CREDITS == TOTAL CREDITS 


ERP and EPM systems:

Debits are +ve 
Credits are -ve

Signs are flipped, when viewed in smart viewed(for example income is -ve in EPM systems )
Debits +ve , credits -ve irrespective of accounts

reports flip signs for readability

Two conventions:
In ERPs ---> Debits +ve , credits -ve ( simple one rule )
In Accounting standards ---> Debits and credits increases respective account balance


Assets = liabilities + Equity

LHS ----> Debit Nature
RHS ---> Credit Nature ( Exception, Expenses as they decrease equity )
